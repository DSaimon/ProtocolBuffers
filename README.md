# Getting Started

First to all you need the protoc compiler installed and configured, please follow the instructions here [Installation](https://github.com/cerezo074/ProtocolBuffers/blob/main/Package%20Compilation/README.md). 

Every example contains its depedencies with **go modules**(it comes build-in with go) and a **makefile** that contains 2 commands *build* and *run*. If you build you will generate protopb files in go. To run a command just need to do with make *command* followed with the *target*(action).

 - *make build*
